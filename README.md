This is an assignment for an Operating Systems course that focuses on implementing user-level threads (ULT) and kernel-level threads (KLT) in the xv6 operating system. The assignment is divided into three main tasks:

User Level Thread Framework: Implementing a cooperative user-level thread framework, including thread creation, scheduling, and management functions. The framework should support a priority scheduling policy.
Kernel Level Thread Framework: Modifying the xv6 kernel to support kernel-level threads. This involves modifying the process control block (PCB) and creating a kernel thread control block (KTCB). The task also includes implementing system calls for thread creation, management, and synchronization.
Testing: Testing the implemented ULT and KLT frameworks by applying provided patches and running test cases.

The assignment covers various aspects of thread management, including scheduling policies, context switching, synchronization, and system call implementation. It provides hands-on experience with modifying the xv6 kernel and implementing user-space and kernel-space thread frameworks.
